- About -> I am a graduate of Pennsylvania State University where I received an undergraduate degree in Supply Chain & Information Systems as well as a minor in Information Systems. I have formal education in SQL, but am self taught in Python, HTML, CSS, C++, and VBA. A long time ago I was told to 'find something where 2 hours feels like 20 minutes' so here I am, showing you what feels like 5 hours of work.

- Purpose -> Career advancement. I am looking to transition into a more technical application of Supply Chain and Logistics, and would like to hone my skills as well as show you what I am capable of.
